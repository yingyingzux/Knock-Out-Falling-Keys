# Knock out Falling Keys
Looking for a break from your busy life? Come and knock out some falling keys before they hit the ground! You can tap on a key to make it go away, or if you prefer using a desktop browser, type a key from your keyboard that matches one that's closest to the bottom to knock it out.
