# Knock-Out-Falling-Keys
A game written by ChatGPT-3.5, guided by Yingying

If you're looking to unwind and destress, come and knock out some falling keys before they hit the ground by either clicking on them or typing a matching key (desktop only). See how many keys you can knock out before time runs out. 

I hope you enjoy it.
