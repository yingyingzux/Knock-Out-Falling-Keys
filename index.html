        <!-- Modal content -->
        <p>Looking for a break from your busy life? Come and knock out some falling keys before they hit the ground! You can tap on a key to make it go away, or if you prefer using a desktop browser, type a key from your keyboard that matches one that's closest to the bottom to knock it out.</p>
        <p>This is game developed from scratch by ChatGPT-3.5, with my guidance on design, coding, debugging and QA.</p>
        <p>I hope you have fun. Share with anyone that you think that may enjoy it.</p>
